noisyPresence.png: 
Public opinion when different proportions of noisy users are on either side of the attitudinal spectrum. The peak in the graph represents the consensus of a group of commenting users around an attitude.

AllUsers.png:
Network illustration of a simulation based on DHPA model. Blue nodes represent users with a positive attitude, while red nodes correspond to users with a negative attitude. Node size reflects their in-degree, and directed edges represent following connections.

degree-distribution.png:
Log-log plot of the degree distribution of the generated DHPA network. The drown line corresponds to the slope of the graph and has a value of 2.3.

noisyGraph.png:
Graph of the public opinion when 20% of users who have an extreme attitude are noisy users. The right cluster represent users with a positive attitude, while the left cluster correspond to users with a negative attitude. Node size reflects their in-degree, and directed edges represent following connections.

density-std2.png:
Public opinion formation on different network density.

population2.png:
Public opinion in social networks with different population rates of positive and negative attitudes.

encourage.png:
Histogram of expressed opinions when 40% of users with positive attitudes left the social network. The peak in the graph represents the consensus of a group of commenting users around an attitude. The Blue bar charts depict the number of commenting users when 500 users were added to the network, while the red charts represent the number of commenting users at the final state with 1000 users.
