The files related to the final state of the simulation, in which the network becomes polarized and none of the attitude groups succeeds in gaining the consensus of public opinion in their favor. 
These files include two network files in .gephi format. One file represents the state considering all users, while the other represents only the users who express opinion. The visualization of these two situations are also in the form of PNG files.

The interface file is an image of the simulation input parameters during initial setup.

In addition, the files of the tables and the world of Gephi software that are related to the final state are given.

PNG files are related to our illustration of the network situation.
