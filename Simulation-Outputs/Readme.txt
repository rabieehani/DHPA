To better understand how public opinion forms in different scenarios, we have provided an additional example of the experiments described in the article. 
This includes the input parameter values, the final state of the network, snapshots of the network over time, and the network dynamics. 
The final network states and dynamics are available in GEXF, CSV, and other formats, allowing readers to visualize the data using their preferred tools. 
Each experiment also includes examples of our own illustrations.
