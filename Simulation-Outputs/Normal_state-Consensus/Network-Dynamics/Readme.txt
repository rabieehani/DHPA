The network dynamics files include a node set file, an edge set file, and a combined file for each time step. These files can be visualized using tools like Gephi and Cytoscape. The node and edge files contain all nodes and edges, but to analyze public opinion, you should filter nodes with an opinion expression status equal to 1.

Additionally, snapshots of the state of the network from start to finish are included for the reader to review or use for further illustration if interested.
