The files related to the final state of the simulation, where public opinion reaches a consensus, include two network files in .gephi format. One file represents the state considering all users, while the other represents only the users who express opinion. The visualization of these two situations are also in the form of PNG files.


The interface file is an image of the simulation input parameters during initial setup.

In addition, the files of the tables and the world of Gephi software that are related to the final state are given.

PNG files are related to our illustration of the network situation. As you can see, if we filter the users who express their opinion, we will see that the public opinion has reached a consensus.
