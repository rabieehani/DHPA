This experiment demonstrates how public opinion reaches a consensus in a normal state without the presence of noisy users. Consensus is achieved when the majority of individuals expressing an opinion share a similar viewpoint.

The interface file is an image of the simulation input parameters during initial setup.

Here we have two directories, one containing files related to the final state of the simulation and the other containing files related to the dynamics of the network during the simulation time.
