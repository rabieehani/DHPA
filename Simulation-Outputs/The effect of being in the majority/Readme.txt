To check the maximum number of members of an attitude group in the network, two scenarios were simulated. In the first scenario, an attitude group has more members in the network from the beginning, and finally the network reaches a consensus in their favor. In the second scenario, the population of the two groups is equal at the beginning, but some members of one group boycott the social network platform in the middle of the network formation, causing the opposite group to be in the majority until the end of the simulation, and in this case, the consensus of public opinion is It will benefit the majority.
